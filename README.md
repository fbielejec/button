# This is a button. You should push it.

Thanks to [Joe Hastings](https://codepen.io/JoeHastings/pen/MwoOeW/) for his button styling.

## UI

### Styling

CSS is handled with `less`.
`lein less once` or `lein less auto` to compile `less` to css.

### Run
`lein repl` or start [cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) in a `ui` namespace.
`(start-ui!)` will fire up [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel).
